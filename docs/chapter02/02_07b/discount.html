 * This program determines a discount depending on

 *   - Prompt the customer for the item price.
 *   - Prompt the customer for their age. 
 *   - If the age is between 21 and 65
 *       - they get a 5% discount (0.05)
 *   - Otherwise:
 *       - they get a 10% discount (0.10)
 *   - Calculate the discounted price.
 *   - Print the discounted price.
